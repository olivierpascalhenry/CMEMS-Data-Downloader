version=Version number. Once the file has been created and is ready to be used by the database, the version number starts at 1.0. Each modification increase the version number (1.0 -> 1.1, 1.2, ...).
creation_date=Date of file creation.
server_url=The URL used to access the product for download (ex: http://nrt.cmems-du.eu/motu-web/Motu).
ftp_url=The URL used to access the product through FTP for download (ex: ftp://nrt.cmems-du.eu/Core/).
domain=Geographical domain, as presented in the CMEMS catalogue (ex: Global, Baltic, Arctic, ...), in which the product has been registered.
type=Product type, as presented in the CMEMS catalogue (ex: Physics, Biochemistry, ...).
source=Where the product come from, as presented in the CMEMS catalogue (ex: Satellite, Model, In situ, ...).
mode=Delivery mode of the product, as presented in the CMEMS catalogue (ex: Near real time, Delayed mode, ...).
product=Product serial number (ex: SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L3_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_008_044).
short_description=A short description of the product. It can be found following the link of a product in the CMEMS catalogue. HTML code can be used if necessary.
description=Full description of the product. It can be found following the link of a product in the CMEMS catalogue. HTML code can be used if necessary.
temporal_resolution=Temporal resoulution of the product, as described in the product webpage. Multiple resolutions are possible and must serparated by a coma (ex: monthly-mean, dayly-mean, ...).
level=Processing level, as described in the product webpage (ex: L4, L3, ...).
dataset_type=type of dataset in a product, as described in the product webpage (ex:grid or swath).
vertical=Vertical coverage of the product, as described in the product webpage (ex: surface, from -2000 to 0 (152 levels), ...).
swath_vertical=if a product has a vertical coverage "from x to x", it can be detailed here, with max and min separated by "to" (ex: 500/1000/2000to0/500/1500). If each dataset of a product has a different vertical coverage, details must be separated by a coma (ex: 500/1000/2000to0/500/1500,400/800/1200to0/400/800). If follows what is described in the product webpage. if swath_vertical is not necessary, "None" should be written after "=".
temporal=Temporal coverage of the product, as described in the product webpage (ex: from 2010-01-15T00:00:00Z to 2016-01-15T00:00:00Z). "Present" can be used to replace the last date if the product continue to be developed. To "Present" it is also possible to add "+x" with "x" equal to a number of days if the product includes prediction in the future.
swath_temporal=If different temporal coverages exist for all datasets, it is possible to enter them here. They should be written this way "2010-01-15to2016-01-15", and separate by coma. "Present" can be added (with "x+") to replace the last date of each dataset. If swath_temporal is not necessary, "None" should be written after "=".
swath_temporal_resolution=if different temporal means are necessary for all datasets, codes can be entered here, based on the "material_functions.py" file and on the "self.temporal_step_name" object (ex: mm,dm or just in, ...). If swath_temporal_resolution is not necessary, "None" should be written after "=".
production=Production unit responsible for the product (ex: INS-IFREMER-BREST-FR).
image=Image to give an example of what it is possible to achieve with the product (ex: To be included in the software, equal to None actually).
variables=Variables included in the product. Each variable is separated by a coma to form a list. Variable names in that file must be equal to the variable names in the requested NetCDF file(s). The real name should be integrated in the "self.variables_name" object of the "material_functions.py" file. If different variables are possible for each dataset, each list of variable must be separated by a "|". If it is not possible to select a variable in a product (product considered as swath, or as DGF), None should be written after the equal (in that case all variables from a dataset are downloaded). (ex: bottomT|uo,vo|siconc,sithick,usi,vsi|mlotst|so|zos|thetao|uo,vo|zos|thetao).
swath=All datasets of a product. If multiple datasetsn they must be separated by a coma. (ex: MetO-GLO-PHYS-dm-BED,MetO-GLO-PHYS-dm-CUR)
suffix=All product can be subseted (TDS), considered as whole dataset (DGF), and/or downloadable by FTP (FTP). The suffix is mandatory and can be one parameter(TDS or DGF or FTP) or a list of parameters (ex: TDS,FTP) based on the product webpage.
other_parameters=If other parameters are needed in the future, they will be written here. Equal to None actually.
