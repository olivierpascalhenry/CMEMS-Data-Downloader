August 12 2018, Release version 0.9.0
=====================================
Version for testing purposes.

  FIXED:
    - few issues with the udpate system on linux have been fixed.
    - an issue was fixed in the creation of the database from .dat files.
    - once an update of the database has been performed, the update icon should be deactivated. It has been fixed.

    - fixed an issue between file size 'b' and 'B'.
  
  ADDED:
    - CDD can now check new product files in its GitHub repository. If new products have been found, CDD will inform the user that he can download them automatically.
    - if a product is missing from the database (has been deleted inadvertently), it will be automatically downloaded from its repository on github during an update of the database.
    - each product downloaded from the database folder on GitHub is checked based on its SHA checksum. If the test is a success, each product is transfered in the CDD database directory. If the test fails, a warning is displayed at the end of the process and the wrong product file is deleted.
    
  MODIFIED:
    - the number of request to the GitHub API has been reduced to only two per update check (software + database).
