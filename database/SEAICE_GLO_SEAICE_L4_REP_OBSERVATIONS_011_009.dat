short_description=The reprocessed sea ice concentration dataset of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF (OSI-409), covering the period from October 1978 to April 2015 (SMMR and SSM/I). Ice concentration is computed from atmospherically corrected SSM/I brightness temperatures, using a combination of state-of-the-art algorithms and dynamic tie-points. It includes error-bars for each grid cell (uncertainties). This Version of the dataset was released in mid-2015.
description=Short description:<br>The reprocessed sea ice concentration dataset of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF (OSI-409), covering the period from October 1978 to April 2015 (SMMR and SSM/I).

Continuous monitoring of sea ice globally on a daily basis started with the launch of SeaSat in June 1978 and October the same year Nimbus 7 both with a SMMR instrument on board. SMMR was the first multi frequency and dual polarization microwave radiometer satellite instrument which was particularly well suited for sea ice monitoring. American satellite microwave radiometer instruments still provide sea ice observations today in an unbroken record since 1978. The Nimbus 7 SMMR brightness temperature data from October 1978 to August 1987 was provided by our partner in the project, NSIDC. EUMETSAT purchased the DMSP SSM/I data from Remote Sensing Systems. EUMETSAT initiated the reprocessing of both microwave radiometer datasets in 2005 and the OSI SAF team developed a new processing chain and selected new algorithms. The initial development has been done in cooperation with the Met Office and NSIDC. Further development is ongoing. Both the SMMR, SSM/I and SSMIS datasets from October 1978 to April 2015 for both hemispheres have been processed using a sea ice concentration algorithm and methodology which is consistent for all 7 sensors. The first version the global sea ice concentration dataset was complete in 2010. This version was completed in 2015. Updates are planned with current satellites.<br><br>Processing information:<br>Algorithm The ice concentration algorithm is a linear combination of Comiso bootstrap in frequency mode over open water and the Bristol algorithm over ice. These two algorithms have low sensitivity to errors over their respective domains. Atmospheric correction Before the ice concentration estimation the measured brightness temperatures are compensated explicitly for the influence of atmospheric water vapor and water surface roughness caused by wind using ECMWF numerical weather prediction data and radiative transfer modeling. This practice is similar to the operational OSISAF ice concentration processing and minimizes the error due to these two error sources.<br><br>Error estimates:<br>The remaining ice concentration estimate error is quantified for every data point using the tie-point variability and a model for the radiometer foot-print smearing. Tie-points are the typical signatures of ice and water used by all sea ice concentration algorithms. Dynamical tie-points Inter sensor differences and sensor drift is a serous issue when computing long time series intended for climate studies. In order to minimize these problems the algorithm is using dynamical tie-points adjusted to the typical signatures of ice and open water for each channel on a monthly basis.<br><br>Description of observation methods/instruments:<br>Nimbus 7 SMMR / DMSP SSM/I / DMSP SSMIS
