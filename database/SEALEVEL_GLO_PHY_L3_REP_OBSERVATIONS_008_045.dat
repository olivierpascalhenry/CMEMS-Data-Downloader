short_description=Altimeter satellite along-track sea surface heights anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year 2012 mean. All the missions are homogenized with respect to a reference mission (see QUID document or http://duacs.cls.fr pages for processing details). The product gives additional variables (e.g. Absolute Dynamic Topography, ADT) that can be used to change the physical content for specific needs.
description=Short description: Altimeter satellite along-track sea surface heights anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year 2012 mean. All the missions are homogenized with respect to a reference mission (see QUID document or http://duacs.cls.fr pages for processing details). The product gives additional variables (e.g. Absolute Dynamic Topography, ADT) that can be used to change the physical content for specific needs. Detailed description: This product is processed by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system. It serves in near-real time the main operational oceanography and climate forecasting centers in Europe and worldwide. It processes data from all altimeter missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-1, T/P, ENVISAT, GFO, ERS1/2. It provides a consistent and homogeneous catalogue of products for varied applications, both for near real time applications and offline studies. Processing information: To produce SLA in delayed-time (REPROCESSED), the system uses the Geophysical Data Records which are computed from a Precise Orbit Ephemeris (POE) and are delivered within 3 months depending on the mission. Reanalysis products are more precise than NRT products. The system acquires and then synchronizes altimeter data and auxiliary data; each mission is homogenized using the same models and corrections. The Input Data Quality Control checks that the system uses the best altimeter data. The multi-mission cross-calibration process removes any residual orbit error, or long wavelength error (LWE), as well as large scale biases and discrepancies between various data flows; all altimeter fields are interpolated at crossover locations and dates. After a repeat-track analysis, a mean profile, which is peculiar to each mission, or a Mean Sea Surface (MSS) (when the orbit is non repetitive) is subtracted to compute sea level anomaly. The MSS is available via the Aviso+ dissemination (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/mss.html). Data are then cross validated, filtered from residual noise and small scale signals (sla_filtered variable). The ADT (Absolute Dynamic Topography, adt_filtered variable) is then computed as follows: adt_filtered=sla_filtered+MDT where MDT is the Mean Dynamic Topography distributed by Aviso+ (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/mdt.html).
