The biogeochemical model used is PISCES (Aumont, in prep). It is a model of intermediate complexity designed for global ocean applications (Aumont and Bopp, 2006) and is part of NEMO modeling platform. It has 24 prognostic variables and simulates biogeochemical cycles of oxygen, carbon and the main nutrients controlling phytoplankton growth (nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, silicic acid and iron). The model distinguishes four plankton functional types based on size: two phytoplankton groups (small = nanophytoplankton and large = diatoms) and two zooplankton groups (small = microzooplankton and large = mesozooplankton). Prognostic variables of phytoplankton are total biomass in C, Fe, Si (for diatoms) and chlorophyll and hence the Fe/C, Si/C, Chl/C ratios are variable. For zooplankton, all these ratios are constant and total biomass in C is the only prognostic variable. The bacterial pool is not modeled explicitly. PISCES distinguishes three non-living pools for organic carbon: small particulate organic carbon, big particulate organic carbon and semi-labile dissolved organic carbon. While the C/N/P composition of dissolved and particulate matter is tied to Redfield stoichiometry, the iron, silicon and carbonate contents of the particles are computed prognostically. Next to the three organic detrital pools, carbonate and biogenic siliceous particles are modeled. Besides, the model simulates dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. In PISCES, phosphate and nitrate + ammonium are linked by constant Redfield ratio (C/N/P = 122/16/1), but cycles of phosphorus and nitrogen are decoupled by nitrogen fixation and denitrification. The distinction of two phytoplankton size classes, along with the description of multiple nutrient co-limitations allows the model to represent ocean productivity and biogeochemical cycles across major biogeographic ocean provinces (Longhurst, 1998). PISCES has been successfully used in a variety of biogeochemical studies (e.g. Bopp et al. 2005; Gehlen et al. 2006;2007; Schneider et al. 2008; Steinacher et al. 2010; Tagliabue et al. 2010, Séférian et al., 2013). The biogeochemical model is initialized with World Ocean Atlas 2001 for nitrate, phosphate, oxygen and silicate (Conkright et al. 2002), with GLODAP climatology including anthropogenic CO2 for Dissolved Inorganic Carbon and Alkalinity (Key et al. 2004) and, in the absence of corresponding data products, with model fields for dissolved iron and dissolved organic carbon.Until October 19th 2016, the biogeochemical model PISCES (NEMO3.2) is forced offline by daily fields of Mercator Ocean PSY3V3R3 1/4 degree horizontal resolution physics system (Lellouche et al., 2013). The main features of this dynamical ocean are:* NEMO 3.1* Atmospheric forcing from 3-hourly ECMWF analysis products, CORE bulk formulation* Vertical diffusivity coefficient is computed by solving the TKE equation* Sea-Ice model: LIM2 with the Elastic-Viscous-Plastic rheology* Initial conditions: Levitus 2005 climatology for temperature and salinity. Ifremer/Cersat data for sea ice concentration and GLORYS2V1 for sea ice thickness.* Data assimilation scheme: SAM2v1 (Kalman filter with SEEK formulation) + 3D-Var biases correction in temperature and salinity for the slowly evolving large-scale, both with Incremental Analysis Update.* Data assimilated: Sea Surface Temperature (Reynolds AVHRR-AMSR 1/4°); Sea Surface Height (Jason2, Cryosat, Saral, HY2); InSitu temperature and salinity vertical profiles from Coriolis Center with Extra Quality control; hybrid MSSH.A special treatment is done on vertical diffusivity coefficient (Kz): the daily mean is done on Log10(Kz) after a filtering of enhanced convection (Kz increased artificially to 10 m2.s-1 when the water column is unstable). The purpose of this Log10 is to average the orders of magnitudes and to give more weight to small values of vertical diffusivity.From October 19th 2016 on, the biogeochemical model PISCES (NEMO3.2) is forced offline by daily fields of Copernicus product GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHYS_001_024 coarsened at ¼° resolution.
