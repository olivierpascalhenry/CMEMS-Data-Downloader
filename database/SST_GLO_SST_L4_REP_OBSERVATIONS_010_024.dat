short_description=For the Global Ocean - The ESA SST CCI global Sea Surface Temperature Reprocessed product provides gap-free maps of daily average SST at 20 cm depth at 0.05deg.x 0.05deg. horizontal grid resolution, using satellite data from the (A)ATSR and AVHRR series of sensors.
description=Short description:<br>For the Global Ocean - The ESA SST CCI global Sea Surface Temperature Reprocessed product provides gap-free maps of daily average SST at 20 cm depth at 0.05deg.x 0.05deg. horizontal grid resolution, using satellite data from the (A)ATSR and AVHRR series of sensors.<br><br>Detailed description:<br>The ESA SST CCI level 4 analyses were produced by running the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system to provide a high resolution (1/20deg. - approx. 5km) daily analysis of the daily average sea surface temperature (SST) at 20 cm depth for the global ocean. Only (A)ATSR and AVHRR satellite data processed by the ESA SST CCI project were used, giving a stable product that is independent from in situ data. It also uses reprocessed sea-ice concentration data from the EUMETSAT OSI-SAF.<br><br>Processing information:<br>The ESA SST CCI level 4 output is a daily global coverage combined SST and sea-ice concentration product on a 1/20deg. grid, based on measurements from satellite data sets which are processed using the OSTIA system. OSTIA uses SST data in the common format developed by GHRSST and makes use of the uncertainty estimates and auxiliary fields as part of the quality control and analysis procedure. Satellite derived sea ice products from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite application Facility (OSI-SAF) provide sea-ice concentration data to the analysis system. After quality control of the SST observations, a bias correction is performed using (A)ATSR data. To provide the final SST analysis, a multi-scale optimal interpolation (OI) is performed using the previous analysis as the basis for a first guess field.<br><br>Description of observation methods/instruments:<br>The observation types currently used in the ESA SST CCI analysis are: ESA SST CCI (A)ATSR and AVHRR satellite SSTs and sea-ice concentration data from the EUMETSAT OSI-SAF.<br><br>Quality/accuracy/calibration information:<br>The analysis product has been validated through calculation of median and robust standard deviation statistics relative to reference data. Inter-comparisons with other data-sets, e.g. Reynolds OI, HadISST, have also been carried out.
