short_description=For the Global Ocean- The OSTIA global Sea Surface Temperature Reanalysis product provides daily gap-free maps of: Foundation sea surface temperature (referred to as an L4 product) at 0.05deg.x 0.05deg. horizontal resolution, using in-situ and satellite data from infra-red radiometers. Sea Surface Temperature anomaly from the Pathfinder climatology at 0.25degree x 0.25degree horizontal resolution. This product provides the foundation Sea Surface Temperature, which is the temperature free of diurnal variability. Monthly and seasonal means of the daily Sea Surface Temperature product at 0.25degree x 0.25degree horizontal resolution are also available.

Monthly and seasonal means of the daily Sea Surface Temperature product at 0.25degree x 0.25degree horizontal resolution are also available. Detailed description: The Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system is run by the UK Met Office and produces a high resolution (1/20deg. - approx. 5km) daily analysis of the sea surface temperature (SST) for the global ocean. The OSTIA reanalysis uses satellite data provided by the Pathfinder AVHRR project and reprocessed (A)ATSR data together with in-situ observations from the ICOADS data-set, to determine the sea surface temperature. It also uses reprocessed sea-ice concentration data from the EUMETSAT OSI-SAF. Processing information: The OSTIA output is a daily global coverage combined SST and sea-ice concentration product on a 1/20deg. grid, based on measurements from several satellite and in situ SST data sets. OSTIA uses SST data in the common format developed by GHRSST and makes use of the uncertainty estimates and auxiliary fields as part of the quality control and analysis procedure. Satellite derived sea ice products from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite application Facility (OSI-SAF) provide sea-ice concentration and edge data to the analysis system. After quality control of the SST observations, a bias correction is performed using ATSR-2/AATSR data as a key component. To provide the final SST analysis, a multi-scale optimal interpolation (OI) is performed using the previous analysis as the basis for a first guess field. Monthly and seasonal means and standard deviations of the daily analysis are produced but on a lower resolution (0.25degree x 0.25degree) grid. (The monthly files also contain the monthly mean and standard deviation of the daily sea ice concentration fields.) The anomaly of the OSTIA SST is also calculated from the daily Pathfinder V5.2 climatology at 0.25degree x 0.25degree horizontal resolution.
