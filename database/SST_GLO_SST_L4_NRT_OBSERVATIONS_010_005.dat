short_description=For The Global Ocean - The GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) system has been implemented at the UK Met Office which takes inputs from various analysis production centres on a routine basis and produces ensemble products at 0.25deg.x0.25deg. horizontal resolution.
description=Short description:<br>For The Global Ocean - The GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) system has been implemented at the UK Met Office which takes inputs from various analysis production centres on a routine basis and produces ensemble products at 0.25deg.x0.25deg. horizontal resolution.<br><br>Detailed description:<br>A large number of sea surface temperature (SST) analyses are produced by various institutes around the world, making use of the SST observations provided by the Global High Resolution SST (GHRSST) project. These are used by a number of groups including: numerical weather prediction centres; ocean forecasting groups; climate monitoring and research groups. There is a requirement to develop international collaboration in this field in order to assess and inter-compare the different analyses, and to provide uncertainty estimates on both the analyses and observational products. The GMPE system has been developed for these purposes and is run on a daily basis at the UK Met Office, producing global ensemble median and standard deviations for SST.<br><br>Processing information:<br>The analysis systems currently contributing to the GMPE system are:<ul><li>OSTIA (Met Office, UK);</li><li>RTG_SST_HR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction, USA);</li><li>NAVO K10 (Naval Oceanographic Office, USA);</li><li>MGDSST (Japan Meteorological Agency, Japan);</li><li>RSS MW (Remote Sensing Systems, USA);</li><li>RSS MW+IR (Remote Sensing Systems, USA);</li><li>FNMOC (Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Centre, USA);</li><li>NOAA AVHRR OI (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USA);</li><li>CMC (Meteorological Service of Canada);</li><li>ODYSSEA (MERSEA, EU, produced at Ifremer, France);</li><li>GAMSSA (Bureau of Meteorology, Australia). These analyses are interpolated onto a regular 1/4 degree resolution global grid, and the ensemble median and standard deviations are calculated.</li></ul>- Global daily SST ensemble median and standard deviation on a 1/4 degree grid.<br><br>Description of observation methods/instruments:<br>Each analysis which contributes to the GMPE product uses different observational data-sets including both in situ and satellite SST data (provided through GHRSST).<br><br>Quality/accuracy/calibration information:<br>The GMPE product itself is used as a monitoring tool for inter-comparison between data-sets and quality estimates have not so far been produced.<br><br>Suitability, expected type of users/uses:<br>The GMPE product is mainly used as a monitoring tool for analysis data producers to assess the consistency between various SST analysis products. The standard deviation product can be used as an estimate of the confidence to be place in each product contributing to the ensemble.<br><br>Parameters:<ul><li>sea_surface_temperature</li><li>Standard deviation of input analyses </li></ul>
