short_description=For the Global Ocean - The IFREMER CERSAT surface wind climatology Fields include wind components (meridional and zonal), wind module, wind stress. They are estimated from ASCAT retrievals. The analyses are estimated as monthly averaged data over global ocean with spatial resolution of 0.25x0.25 degrees in latitude and longitude, They are available since April 2007.

It is estimated from daily global wind fields calculated from retrievals derived from ASCAT scatterometer onboard METOP-A satellite. It consists of six variables including monthly averaged wind speed, zonal and meridional wind components, wind stress amplitude and the associated components. They are calculated as arithmetic means of ASCAT daily wind analyses. The gridded daily wind and wind stress fields have been estimated over global oceans from Metop/ASCAT retrievals using objective method. The analyses use standard products ASCAT L2b during the period April 2007 to present. ASCAT retrievals occurring during April 21, 2007 to November 20, 2008 are calculated as real winds. They are converted to equivalent neutral winds using bulk parametrisation Coare3.0 (Fairall et al, 2003). Coare3.0 parameterization is also used for wind stress estimations. They are calculated over ASCAT swaths from observations. The resulting fields are estimated as equivalent neutral-stability 10-m daily winds, and have spatial resolutions of 0.25° in longitude and latitude. The objective method aims to provide daily-averaged gridded wind speed, zonal component, meridional component, wind stress and the corresponding components at global scale. The error associated to each parameter, related to the sampling impact and wind space and time variability, is provided too. More details about data, objective method, computation algorithm may be found in (Bentamy et al, 2011). For monthly calculation purpose, only valid daily data available within each month of the period 2007 trough 2011 are used. The monthly winds are estimated at each grid point (0.25°x0.25°) from at least 25 daily values available at the same grid point. The associated root mean square (rms) values are also calculated at each grid point and used as quality control variable. The resulting final files are provided as CMEMS products in CF-1.4 compliant NetCDF format.
