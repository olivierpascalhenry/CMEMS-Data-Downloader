short_description=For the Global Ocean - “Optics” products are derived from a combination of SeaWIFS, MODIS-Aqua, MERIS and VIIRS sensor data. These products include the RRSxxx, which is the daily remote sensing reflectance at xxx nm (expressed in sr-1). The list of spectral values is: 412, 443, 490, 510, 555, and 670 nm.
description=Short description:<br>For the Global Ocean - “Optics” products are derived from a combination of SeaWIFS, MODIS-Aqua, MERIS and VIIRS sensor data. These products include the RRSxxx, which is the daily remote sensing reflectance at xxx nm (expressed in sr-1). The list of spectral values is: 412, 443, 490, 510, 555, and 670 nm.<br><br>Detailed description:<br>These products span a period from November 1997 to December 2015 at a nominal resolution of 4km. They were produced using algorithms and processing developed in the European Space Agencies' Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (ESA OC-CCI) project. The RRS product is defined as the ratio of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance at 412, 443, 490, 510, 555, and 670 nm wavebands, and can also be expressed as the ratio of normalized water leaving Radiance (nLw) and the extra-terrestrial solar irradiance (F0). The Rrs used were produced by the OC-CCI project whereby the SeaWiFS, VIIRS, MODIS, and MERIS sensor data were atmospherically corrected, band shifted to SeaWiFS wavebands, and merged. Standard masking criteria for detecting clouds or other contamination factors were applied to the sensor data, i.e., land, cloud, sun glint, atmospheric correction failure, high total radiance, large solar zenith angle (70deg), large spacecraft zenith angle (56deg), coccolithophores, negative water leaving radiance, and normalized water leaving radiance at 555 nm 0.15 Wm-2 sr-1 (McClain et al., 1995).<br><br>How to reference product:<br>The User will ensure that the original product OCEANCOLOUR_GLO_OPTICS_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_009_064 -or value added products or derivative works developed from it including pictures- shall credit CMEMS and ESA/CCI by explicitly making mention of the originator in the following manner: """"Generated using Copernicus Marine and ESA/CCI Product"""". For publication purposes, the User shall ensure that the credits mention CMEMS and ESA/CCI in the following manner: """"This study has been conducted using Copernicus Marine and ESA/CCI Product"""". For all detailed information concerning the use of this product, see the Service Commitments and Licence on the Copernicus Marine website.<br><br>Processing information:<br>Processing of these data was mainly carried out in the OC-CCI framework producing a climate-quality consistent dataset using the latest and most complete knowledge of satellite sensor calibration, characterization and attitude, complete (as far as possible) ancillary data sets, latest versions of models and algorithms etc. The data were then repackaged, using custom software, to suit the requirements of CMEMS.<br><br>Description of observation methods/instruments:<br>The remote sensing of Ocean Colour represents a measure of the spectral variations in the light leaving the water surface, subsequently interpreted in terms of concentrations of optically-significant constituents in the water. The electromagnetic signal collected by the sensor on-board the satellite is largely determined by photons that have never reached the water surface, but have been backscattered within the atmosphere through multiple interactions between gas molecules and aerosols. After removing the atmospheric contribution, the water leaving radiance recorded at a given time by the satellite reflects the optical properties of the water which, in turn, mirrors a specific structure and biogeochemical composition of the marine waters.<br><br>Quality / Accuracy / Calibration information:<br>The user is referred to the QUID documentation.<br><br>Suitability, Expected type of users / uses:<br>This product is meant for use for educational purposes and for the managing of the marine safety, marine resources, marine and coastal environment and for climate and seasonal studies.
