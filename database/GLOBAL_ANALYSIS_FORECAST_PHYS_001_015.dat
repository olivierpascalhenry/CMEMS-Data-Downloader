short_description=The UK Met Office weakly coupled data assimilation and forecast system is used to provide 10 days of 3D global ocean forecasts, at ¼ degree, updated daily. The ocean analysis is also provided daily, along with an updated analysis a day later which makes use of more observations. This product includes daily mean files of temperature, salinity, currents, sea level, mixed layer depth and sea ice parameters (and hourly instantaneous sea surface temperature, sea surface height and surface currents).
description=Short description:<br>The UK Met Office weakly coupled data assimilation and forecast system is used to provide 10 days of 3D global ocean forecasts, at ¼ degree, updated daily. The ocean analysis is also provided daily, along with an updated analysis a day later which makes use of more observations. This product includes daily mean files of temperature, salinity, currents, sea level, mixed layer depth and sea ice parameters (and hourly instantaneous sea surface temperature, sea surface height and surface currents).<br><br>Detailed description:<br>The Global Ocean output files are displayed with 1/4o horizontal resolution with regular lat/lon projection and 43 vertical levels ranging from 0 to 5500 meters (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250, 2500, 2750, 3000, 3250, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500). Outputs are delivered as daily mean and hourly instantaneous files with Netcdf format (CF/COARDS 1.0 convention).<br><br>Processing information:<br>The weakly coupled data assimilation and forecast system uses a Met Office Unified Model v10.6 atmosphere configuration (at ~ 40 km resolution) coupled to a NEMO v3.4 ocean configuration and to the multi-thickness-category sea ice model CICE v4.1. The 4D-var atmospheric data assimilation uses the VAR code in which a variational bias correction scheme is also implemented. The ocean data assimilation uses a variational (3D-var) scheme in NEMOVAR, a code developed specifically for use with NEMO and further tuned for the 1/4o global model. Key features of NEMOVAR are the multivariate relationships which are specified through a linearised balance operator and the use of an implicit diffusion operator to model background error correlations. Operationally there are multiple 6-hour data assimilation windows which are run at least 24 hours behind real time to provide an improved analysis through the inclusion of profile and satellite data with a later arrival time. On 00Z cycles there is a catch-up to real time which provides a NRT analysis and allows initialization of the 10-day forecasts.. Ocean observations assimilated include satellite SST data, in-situ SSTs from moored buoys, drifting buoys and ships (these are considered unbiased and used as a reference for satellite SST bias correction), sea level anomaly observations from Jason-2, Jason-3, AltiKa, Cryosat-2 & Sentinel-3a, sub-surface temperature and salinity profiles (from Argo, underwater gliders, moored buoys, marine mammals, and manual profiling methods) and sea ice concentration (SSMIS data provided by OSI-SAF as a daily gridded product). The NEMO global ocean configuration uses the ORCA025 grid (with a 1/4o or 28km horizontal grid spacing at the equator reducing to 7km at high southern latitudes, and ~10km in the Arctic Ocean) and is based on the configuration developed by Mercator Ocean. The vertical coordinate system is based on geopotential levels using the DRAKKAR 75 level set which provides an increased near surface resolution (including 1m surface layers to help resolve shallow mixed layers and potentially capture diurnal variability) without compromising resolution at depth. Partial cell thicknesses at the ocean floor allow a better representation of ocean topography and in combination with an energy- and enstrophy-conserving momentum advection scheme and a free slip lateral boundary condition improve the mesoscale circulation and in particular the simulation of western boundary currents. The sea ice model runs on the same ORCA025 grid as NEMO, and with 5 thickness categories. Due to constraints when running coupled to the Unified Model atmosphere the coupled data assimilation system use the zero-layer thermodynamic model of Semtner, with a single layer of both ice and snow. Ice dynamics are calculated using the elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) scheme of Hunke and Dukowicz.
