short_description=For the Global Ocean- Gridded objective analysis fields of temperature and salinity using profiles from the in-situ near real time database are produced monthly. Objective analysis is based on a statistical estimation method that allows presenting a synthesis and a validation of the dataset, providing a support for localized experience (cruises), providing a validation source for operational models, observing seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability.

It produces temperature and salinity gridded fields. The system is based on a statistical estimation method (objective analysis). This system allows presenting a synthesis and a validation of the dataset, providing a support for localized experience (cruises), providing a validation source for operational models, observing seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability. This system is operated by the in-situ TAC monthly for validation purposes and for the research community: at the beginning of each month the daily fields of the previous month are reprocessed using all the data available for the period. These monthly data are distributed freely through CMEMS distribution means.
