short_description=Altimeter satellite along-track sea surface heights anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year 2012 mean. All the missions are homogenized with respect to a reference mission (see QUID document or http://duacs.cls.fr pages for processing details). The product gives additional variables (e.g. Absolute Dynamic Topography) that can be used to change the physical content for specific needsThis product is processed by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system. It serves in near-real time the main operational oceanography and climate forecasting centers in Europe and worldwide.

It serves in near-real time the main operational oceanography and climate forecasting centers in Europe and worldwide.<br><br>Detailed description:<br>It processes data from all altimeter missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-1, T/P, ENVISAT, GFO, ERS1/2. It provides a consistent and homogeneous catalogue of products for varied applications, both for near real time applications and offline studies. To produce maps of SLA (Sea Level Anomalies) in near-real time, the system exploits the most recent datasets available based on the enhanced OGDR+IGDR production. The system acquires and then synchronizes altimeter data and auxiliary data; each mission is homogenized using the same models and corrections. The Input Data Quality Control checks that the system uses the best altimeter data. The multi-mission cross-calibration process removes any residual orbit error, or long wavelength error (LWE), as well as large scale biases and discrepancies between various data flows; all altimeter fields are interpolated at crossover locations and dates. After a repeat-track analysis, a mean profile, which is peculiar to each mission, or a Mean Sea Surface (MSS) (when the orbit is non repetitive) is subtracted to compute sea level anomaly. The MSS is available via the Aviso+ dissemination (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/mss.html). Data are then cross validated, filtered from residual noise and small scale signals, and finally sub-sampled (sla_filtered variable). The ADT (Absolute Dynamic Topography, adt_filtered variable) is then computed as follows: adt_filtered=sla_filtered+MDT where MDT is the Mean Dynamic Topography distributed by Aviso+ (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/mdt.html).
