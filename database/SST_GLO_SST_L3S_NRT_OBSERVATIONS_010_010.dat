Both a high resolution (1/20° - approx. 6 km) daily analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) and a reduced resolution (1/4° - approx. 28 km) daily analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) are produced for the global ocean and some lakes. SST anomalies are calculated on the reduced resolution analysis from the daily Pathfinder climatology.As part of the analysis procedure, an estimate of the bias in each of the contributing satellite sensors is made. This is done by calculating match-ups between each satellite sensor and a reference data-set (currently comprised of the in situ data and a subset of the MetOp AVHRR satellite data). These differences are then input to an Optimal Interpolation procedure to produce gridded fields of bias in each sensor. OSTIA uses satellite data provided by the GHRSST project together with in-situ observations, to determine the sea surface temperature.<br><br>Processing information:<br>The OSTIA system has been running operationally at the UK Met Office since November 2006. The output is a daily global coverage combined SST and sea-ice concentration product based on measurements from several satellite and in situ SST data sets. OSTIA uses SST data in the common format developed by GHRSST and makes use of the uncertainty estimates and auxiliary fields as part of the quality control and analysis procedure. Satellite derived sea ice products from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite application Facility (OSI-SAF) provide sea-ice concentration data to the analysis system. After quality control of the SST observations, a bias correction is performed. To provide the final SST analysis, a multi-scale optimal interpolation (OI) is performed using the previous analysis with a slight relaxation to climatology as the basis for a first guess field.Global daily analyses of foundation SST together with sea-ice concentration and analysis error estimates are produced on a 1/20° grid. Additionally, monthly and seasonal means and standard deviations of the daily analysis are produced on a lower resolution (1/4°) grid. The anomaly of the OSTIA SST is calculated from the daily Pathfinder V5.2 climatology. Files contain anomalies to the Pathfinder daily climatology on a lower resolution (1/4°) grid together with the OSTIA foundation SST. Bias estimates are also produced for each relevant satellite sensor on a lower resolution (1/4°) grid. The match-up criteria are: reference observations within a radius of 25km and a time interval of 24 hours.<br><br>Description of observation methods/instruments:<br>The observation types currently used in the OSTIA analysis are:<ul><li>in situ SST from drifters, ships, moored buoys.</li><li>satellite SST from AVHRR from NOAA and MetOp satellites, SEVIRI, GOES-East, TMI, IASI.</li><li>sea-ice concentration data from the EUMETSAT OSI-SAF. </li></ul>The sensors/satellites for which bias estimates are currently produced are:<ul><li>TMI/TRMM</li><li>SEVIRI/MSG</li><li>GOES-East/GOES 13</li><li>AVHRR/MetOp</li><li>AVHRR/NOAA</li><li>NAR AVHRR LAC product</li><li>IASI/MetOp</li></ul><br><br>Quality/accuracy/calibration information:<br>An automated verification system produces daily mean and RMS statistics of observation-minus-analysis and observations-minus-background for each of the observation types used in the analysis. OSTIA is also included in the GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) system which provides a monitoring tool for inter-comparison with other analysis data-sets. The OSTIA SSTs which are obtained after the bias correction procedure have been shown to have small bias compared to independent validation data.<br><br>Suitability, expected type of users/uses:<br>The following uses for the output are current or projected:<ul><li>As a lower boundary condition in NWP weather forecasting systems.</li><li>As a data-set for constraining/validating surface temperature and sea-ice in short-range ocean forecasting systems.</li><li>As a data-set for constraining/validating surface temperature and sea-ice in seasonal and longer range (decadal) forecasting systems.</li><li>As a tool for real-time climate monitoring.</li><li>Oceanographic research.</li><li>Producers of SST products.</li></ul><br><br>Parameters:<ul><li>sea_surface_temperature</li><li>estimated error standard deviation of analysed_sst</li><li>sea_ice_area_fraction</li><li>sea/land/lake/ice field composite mask</li><li>sea_surface_temperature_anomaly</li><li>sst_bias_(SAT)</li></ul>
